# Mashed potatoes

_Note: we eat a fair amount of potatoes in Sweden. Boiled, mashed, fried, oven-baked. Cold, hot._

## Ingredients:
- Flour:y potatoes (~500 grams) _[Swedish: Mj√∂lig potatis]_
- Milk (~3 deciliters)
- Salt
- Butter (~100 grams)

## Instructions:
Peel potatoes, cut into equally large pieces. Put in a pot with enough water to
cover all potatoes. Bring it to a boil and let boil. To know when they're done:
stick a knife in a potato and lift it above the water, if it falls off on its
own then it's done.

Pour out the water, and mash the potatoes (typically we have a specific masher
tool for this). You could use a puree press as well, but avoid mixers since it
will make the potatoes sticky.

Add a liberal amount of butter, and a little bit milk. Keep adding milk until
desired texture. Add salt to taste.
