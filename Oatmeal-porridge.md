# Havregrynsgröt

Also known as Oatmeal porridge.

_Note: I think just about every Swede has had this for breakfast. When going to
the french alps, the travel agency bring LOADS of oatmeal on the bus just to
make the Swede guests happy because some people swear by it for breakfast._

## Ingredients:
- Oatmeal (1dl)
- Water (2dl)
- Salt

## Extras (pick any):
- Dried peaches
- Berries
- Raisins
- Honey
- Syrup
- Jam (strawberry, raspberry, lingonberry)
- Milk
- Apple jam/Mashed apples (Äpplemos)

## Instructions:
Put all standard ingredients in a pot, bring to a boil and then let simmer on medium to high eat until the porridge is thick — there are different personal preferences to how thick. Don't forget to stir often, it burns easily!

Eat in a bowl. You'll most likely want some of the extras to bring any taste to it!
