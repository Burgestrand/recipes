# Pantry

Most of these will be found in any household.

#### Ketcup

Heinz or Findus, each family to their own.

#### Butter

_Swedish: Smör_

Solid square golden package of butter, nothing else.

#### Snabbmakaroner

Macaroni. Takes three minutes to cook once water is boiling.

#### Köttbullar

I'd wager most people don't make their own meatballs too often any more. Buying
it in store is common, a brand you could look for is _Mamma scan_. Smells like
poop when you open the packaging.

#### Milk

Sweden's big on dairy. Most families drink the medium (green) or slightly fattier (red) milk regularly.

#### Saft

Kind of like cordial, bought in most stores, enjoyed by most, comes in various flavours such as raspberry, strawberry, lingonberry, elderflower, wild raspberry, blueberry… and so on!

## Standard measurements:
