# Meatballs

_Note: there are about as many standard recipes as there are families, so here's mine:_

- Minced beef (500 grams) _(note: beef only, no pork/beef mix)_
- Onions (1-2 medium-sized)
- Two slices of garlic
- Liquid veal extract _[Swedish: Kalvfond]_ (about 1 tablespoon)
- Tomato purée (about 1-2 tablespoons)
- A few rounds with black pepper grinder
- (possibly) a teaspoon of salt, the veal extract is already salt so be careful
- Butter for pan frying

## Optional extras _(depends on mood, and what I'm after)_:
- Mix 1.5 decilitres of milk and 5 tablespoons of breadcrumbs/raspings _[Swedish: Ströbröd, available in shops]_
- Let swell for 10 minutes
- Mix with the rest of the ingredients in the bowl
- Add a whole egg to the rest of the ingredients in the bowl

This adds some extra substance and creaminess to the meatballs, and makes them
hold together better. Also makes more meatballs for low extra cost!

## Instructions:
- Chop onions and garlic into fine pieces.
- Mix all ingredients together with your hands in a bowl.
- Roll into bite-sized balls.
- Pan-fry in a small amount butter for up to 4 minutes.

## Tips:
- They should cook all just about all the way through, but no more.
- Let them sit in the pan — don't poke them too much — or they lose their juice, or might break.
- Pan fry them when they're room-temperature to retain juices better.
